/**
 * Animation is a way of describing a set of images that can be used to animate
 * an entity. Animations consist of regions of an image, the indices that should
 * be played, and the time each should be shown. For example, suppose there is
 * an image "glowball.png" with 5 frames. The "cells" will consist of the 5
 * frames (numbered 0 to 4) that can be shown. We can then set an animation such
 * as (0,300)->(2,100)->(0,600)->(4,100) to indicate that the animation should
 * show the 0th frame for 300 milliseconds, then the 2nd frame for 100
 * milliseconds, then the 0th frame for 600 milliseconds, then the 4th frame for
 * 100 milliseconds.
