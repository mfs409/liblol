/**
 * A Level is an interactive portion of the game. Levels can be infinite, or
 * they can have an end goal. Level has two components. One is the part that is
 * visible to the game designer, which involves some limited control over the
 * camera and music, and the ability to request that custom code run after a
 * fixed amount of time. These timers can also be attached to a specific enemy,
 * if desired. Internally, Level is responsible for managing a set of cameras
 * used to display everything that appears on the screen. It is also responsible
 * for keeping track of everything on the screen (Actors, Controls, and
 * Displays), so we can draw the game correctly.
 * <p/>
 * Note that everything in Lol is a level... the splash screen, the choosers,
 * the help, and the game levels themselves.
